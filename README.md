Technologies used:
* MEAN Stack
* Mongodb is used to hold user registration data deployed on a Azure Cosmos DB instance
* bcrypt for password hashing and salting
* Weather Underground API to get the current weather data
* Google Calendar API for scheduling data
* Embedded twitter API -  we included the @Mobify feed as an example and because they were very kind to host us for the hackathon event at their downtown Vancouver office

Some of the interfaces shown on the website are still images and placeholders so that we could get the design of our deployed application on to Azure during the AI Hackathon challenge and match our prototype shown in the above image. If a user registers and logs in they can add chat messages that will show up on the right hand side of the screen. Our intentions for the chat would be to integrate Microsoft's Teams chat-based workspace, so that it enhances out design idea for a fully functioning work place hub. 
 
We would like to thank Microsoft for providing us with Azure credits for the challenge that allowed us to access all the technolgies used to deploy our app quickly and easilty on their cloud hosting servers.
